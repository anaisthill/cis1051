# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

War

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A user v computer card game of war. Where there's a 52 deck of cards and he first player to get all the cards wins. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will allow one player to play a game of war against the computer. The deck of cards will be dealt equally among the player and computer. Then each player will drop their top/first card. The player that dropped the highest value card takes both cards and adds it to their hand. This process continues until one player has won all the cards. If a turn occurs where both players drop the same card, they will have a war and say "I-DE-CLARE-WAR." For the first three syllables a card is placed face down. On the fourth syllable("WAR"), each player will drop the next card in their hand face up. Whichever player has the highest value wins all of the eight cards that were just put down. If both of the fourth cards end up being the same again then the players have to declare war again until someone drops a higher card than the other.  
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Set up the basic structure of the game. Have the user v computer, then set up the deck of cards with the numbers, suits, and faces. Deal 26 cards to each player.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having the code for the comparison of the two cards put down.(The player who put down the card with the higher value wins both cards)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Complete the code to play a full round of the game: the comparison, the "I-DE-CLARE-WAR", etc.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

find a module or code to obtain the deck of cards and put the correct suits, numbers, and faces on them.
